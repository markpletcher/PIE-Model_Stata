  "body": "### Summary\r\nThe Prevention Impact and Efficiency (PIE) Model is a simple microsimulation modeling method and implementation, programmed in Stata, for analyzing the impact and efficiency of an intervention designed to prevent disease from occurring in a population.  The microsimulation methodology allows easy estimation of population-level impact for complex, completely individualizable interventions and targeting of those interventions (i.e., Precision Medicine), assuming the required measurements are available.  **Impact** is expressed as the relative % reduction in disease events that occur (usually over a defined time period), and **Efficiency** is expressed as the number needed to treat (NNT) with the intervention to prevent each disease event from occurring (lower NNT is more efficient).  We provide **template files for implementing this method and step-by-step instructions for how to use the template** downloadable in the linked Github site.  We hope the model will be used by guideline committees and policymakers looking to estimate the population-level impact and efficiency of their recommendations, and will archive submitted implementation files for published projects using the model.\r\n\r\n### Purpose and rationale\r\nPublic health impact can be achieved by 1) setting specific impact priorities, 2) planning and implementing policy designed to fulfill those priorities, and 3) measuring impact and repeating the process.  The Healthy People program (e.g., [Healthy People 2020](https://www.healthypeople.gov/)) is a model for steps 1 and 3, and many diverse organizations attempt step 2, planning and implementing policies, but in our view **there are not easy ways of estimating how any given policy might actually achieve specific public health impact goals**.  Public health initiatives typically specify evidence-based interventions that should move health indicators in the right direction, but by how much?  Which interventions will help the most?  What actual impact will they have on, on a population level, at reducing the incidence of a given disease outcome?  And how efficient are interventions?  If there are downsides to the intervention (e.g., cost, adverse effect risks), these usually scale with the number of individuals exposed to the intervention; so how many people need to be exposed to each intervention to prevent each event (i.e, what is the Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT))?  For example, if we want to reduce cardiovascular disease deaths, [Healthy People 2020 Objective HDS-2](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/heart-disease-and-stroke/objectives), how would one compare the theoretical public health impact and efficiency of the following approaches?:\r\n* A new prevention strategy with higher potential efficacy (e.g., PCSK9 inhibition to lower LDL cholesterol)\r\n* A new biomarker that can identify high-risk persons more accurately (e.g., coronary artery calcium)\r\n* Simply lowering current statin treatment thresholds or improving adherence to current guidelines\r\nWith the goal of developing a tool usable by guideline committees, we developed a simple model designed to produce theoretically-attainable estimates of public health impact and efficiency of targeted prevention strategies.  The model requires only 1) an algorithm for estimating disease risk, 2) a decision rule for how to target a proposed intervention, 3) an algorithm for estimating how much risk is reduced for any given individual from the intervention, and 4) a dataset representative of your target population that includes any measurements required for steps 1-3 (NHANES fulfills many of these requirements).  Once you've programmed your algorithms, the model produces estimates of prevention impact (% reduction in events) and efficiency (number needed to treat to prevent each event) for any combination of intervention and targeting algorithm, and pre-packaged easily-configured tables and figures that illustrate the tradeoffs between impact and efficiency inherent in any targeted prevention intervention.\r\n\r\n### How to Use The Model\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we provide a set of template files for implementing this method in Stata (see PIEModelTemplate_v1.0.zip), and step-by-step instructions for how to use the template.  The template files implement a simple analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate prevention impact and efficiency of statin prescribing for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, comparing risk-based targeting to age-based targeting to illustrate use of the model.  As noted in the model description, these templates are easily adapted for use with a different dataset (other than NHANES), different outcome of interest (other than atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), different intervention (other than statins), and different targeting methods (other than use of risk-based or age-based targeting thresholds).\r\n\r\nSteps 0, 1 and 2 will all require substantial customization tailored to your research question.  These steps will create a standard dataset, however, analysis of which is then quite simple.  The code provided for Steps 3-5 and for the standard Tables and Figures should require only simple configuration to produce useful output - this is the added value of the PIE Model.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\nThe purpose of the Prevention Impact and Efficiency (PIE) Model is to make it easier for \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use.

After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
